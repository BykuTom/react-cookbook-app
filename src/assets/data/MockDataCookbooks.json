While the onions are cooking, whisk together the eggs and milk.Once the onions are soft, pour the egg mixture over top and let it cook (without stirring) until the edges are set (this means cooked/turned solid see photos below). Once the edges are set, use your spatula to pull the edges in toward the center of the pan, letting the unset/liquid egg flow back onto the surface of the pan. Repeat this process until almost all of the egg mixture is set/cooked. Move on to the next step when the egg mixture is still moist and glistening but is mostly cooked. If you cook it until it is dry at this step, your end product will be over cooked and super dry. Yuck.",

You can easily use the dishwasher at high temperature setting or in case you don't have one just wash the jars and dry them in the oven (275 F, 130 C) until completely dry and keep them hot until the jam is ready. It is important to keep the jars hot to prevent them from breaking when you fill them with the hot jam.Deseed the chillies but keep some of the seeds to make sure the jam is hot enough. Deseed and chop red peppers. !Very important: use disposable gloves, and make sure you don't touch your face as this can be very irritating.",

Fold about one-third of the sugar-nut mixture into the egg whites until blended, and then carefully fold in the remaining two-thirds. The batter should be a bit fluid but not runny. It should slowly drip off the spatula and sit on top of the batter in the bowl for a bit before eventually oozing back into it. If it seems a bit stiff at this point, fold once or twice more until it relaxes, although be careful not to over-fold. This correct texture is the key to the macaron and it is better to have a stiffer batter than a looser one.",

Take an 8 cake pan and trace it with a pencil right on the parchment. Turn the paper over so the cake wont be directly on the pencil circle. You will still be able to see it.Measure out the sugar. Prepare vanilla, cornstarch and lemon juice.In a clean and dry medium mixing bowl, place egg whites. With clean and dry hand mixer beaters, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. It is very important that all tools that touch the egg whites are clean and dry. If there is any trace of oil or water on your bowl or mixer paddle attachments, the egg whites wont whip properly.Start adding the sugar, one tablespoon at a time. Whip until the mixture is glossy and thick, and the peaks are stiff. You may run out of sugar before the mixture reaches stiff peaks. Take your time and dont be rushed. Stop occasionally to check the peaks. When the peaks are stiff, stir in vanilla, cornstarch and lemon juice, if using.Scoop the meringue mixture with ice cream scoop on the prepared baking sheet, following the shape of the circle. With an offset spatula, connect the mounds of meringue, especially on the outside.",
